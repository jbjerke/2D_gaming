Game Title: "Time the Ferocious Fire Spirit"


Game Description:
Tim is a simple left-to-right player that can shoot fireballs. 
The goal is for Tim to acquire a score of 10 to prove himself to a wizard who has offered Tim a contribution to his power.
The only way to gain points is to kill those that aim to attack Tim.

So in this world along with Tim, there are two other types of creatures: pinkupines and dogats.
Pinkupines are the little guys rolling along the path. Some will attack Tim, and some will run away.
Pinkupines are how Tim gains points, but only if he hits the ones that attack him.
If Tim hits an innocent pinkupine, he loses points.
If he loses points he does not have, he loses a life.
The dogats are the guys flying around.
They neither attack Tim, nor do they avoid Tim.
Since they do not attack Tim, they do not count towards Tim's score.

If Tim hits or runs into any of the creatures in this world, he loses a life. He's fragile, so be careful.

Good Luck!
