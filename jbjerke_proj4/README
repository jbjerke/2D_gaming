Project no. 4

Project Due Date: 4/6/2018

Game Level:
Tim is a simple left-to-right player. When projectiles are added, he will
be able to project small balls of fire for an attack. There are two other
rather simple creatures on this level: Pinkupines, and Dogats. Some of these
pinkupines and dogats will attack and some will evade. To kill each creature,
Tim will need to hit them with an undetermined about of fireballs. I don't
know if this is in my scope, but I may try to make at least scaling sizes of
pinkupines that require a 1-to-1 amount more attacks to take down. The point will
be that Tim, the fire spirit, needs to kill a certain number of the attacking
enemies to earn points. If he kills any peaceful, evading creatures, he will lose points.
The goal is to acquire enough points so that when he reaches the goal
(the wizard), the wizard will extend a gift to Tim.

Although some of these features such as an attacking AI were probable for
this project, the drawings all took too long, and with my original problem,
I did not have time to include them.


Note: All art from the background to each sprite are original artworks made in
gimp using a tablet with poor calibration and aging issues.
